<h2>Donkey Characteristics</h2>

<p>
	Donkeys are not easily startled (unlike horses) and have a keen sense of curiosity.
</p>
<p>
	Donkeys have a reputation for stubbornness but this is due to their highly developed sense of self preservation. It is difficult to force or frighten a donkey into doing something it sees as contrary to its own best interest or safety.
</p>
<p>
	Donkeys are more independent in their thinking than horses and will reason, then make decisions based on their safety.
</p>
<p>	
	Training a donkey relies upon showing him or her, by words and action, that they can trust you to protect them from harm. They learn what it is we want them to do if we take time to show them.
